# *S. pneumoniae* RASE database

The *S. pneumoniae* RASE database was constructed with the EUCAST breakpoints ([mg/L]): ceftriaxone (CRO): 0.25, erythromycin (ERY): 0.25, benzylpenicillin (PEN): 0.06, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT): 1.00, and tetracycline (TET): 1.00.

The draft assemblies  were downloaded from the SRA FTP server using the accession codes provided in [Table 1](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201558/tables/1) of \[[Croucher *et al.*, 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201558)\].  The phylogenetic tree was downloaded from [DataDryad](https://datadryad.org/handle/10255/dryad.83423) (accession: ‘10.5061/dryad.t55gq’). The pneumococcal ProPhyle index was constructed with the k-mer size k=18.
