# S. pneumoniae RASE DB

The S. pneumoniae RASE database was constructed with the EUCAST breakpoints ([mg/L]): ceftriaxone (CRO): 0.25, erythromycin (ERY): 0.25, benzylpenicillin (PEN): 0.06, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT): 1.00, and tetracycline (TET): 1.00.

The draft assemblies  were downloaded from the SRA FTP server using the accession codes provided in Table 1 in ref24.  The phylogenetic tree was downloaded from DataDryad (accession: ‘10.5061/dryad.t55gq’). The pneumococcal ProPhyle index was constructed with the k-mer size k=18.
